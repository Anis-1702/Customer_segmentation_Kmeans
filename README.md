# Customer_segmentation_Kmeans

1.Load a dataset

2.visualize the feature by using Matplotlib

3.preprocess the feature which needs to be clustered by MIN-Max scalar **(which ranges between 0 to 1)**

4.fit in the K means which locates nearest data points forms clusters

5.plot the cluster and find out how many clusters actually presented which is **ELBOW METHOD**

6. After finding the clusters, give n_clusters to KMEANS

8. find the center point of clusters by using **Kmeans.center.clusters_**

10. plot the clusters with centroids.

12. Give the label based on knowledge on project.
